          <p>
            Srila Prabhupada was born Abhay Charan De on September 1, 1896, to a
            pious Hindu family in Calcutta. As a youth growing up in
            British-controlled India, Abhay became involved with Mahatma
            Gandhi’s civil disobedience movement to secure independence for his
            nation. It was, however, a 1922 meeting with a prominent scholar and
            religious leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, which proved most
            influential on Abhay’s future calling. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a
            leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava denomination, a monotheistic
            tradition within the broad Hindu culture, and asked Abhay to bring
            the teachings of Lord Krishna to the English-speaking world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Abhay became a disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, and
            resolved to carry out his mentor’s request. Abhay, later known by
            the honorific A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, spent the next 32
            years preparing for his journey to west. In 1965, at the age of
            sixty-nine, Srila Prabhupada travelled to New York City aboard a
            cargo ship. The journey was treacherous, and the elderly spiritual
            teacher suffered two heart attacks aboard ship. Arriving in the
            United States with just seven dollars in Indian rupees and his
            translations of sacred Sanskrit texts, Srila Prabhupada began to
            share the timeless wisdom of Krishna consciousness.

          <p>
            His message of peace and goodwill resonated with many young people,
            some of whom came forward to become serious students of the Krishna
            tradition. With the help of these students, Srila Prabhupada rented
            a small storefront on New York’s Lower East Side to use as a temple.
            On July 11, 1966, he officially registered his organization in the
            state of New York, formally founding the International Society for
            Krishna Consciousness. In the eleven years that followed, Srila
            Prabhupada circled the globe 14 times on lecture tours, bringing the
            teachings of Lord Krishna to thousands of people on six continents.
            Men and women from all backgrounds and walks of life came forward to
            accept his message, and with their help, Srila Prabhupadaestablished
            ISKCON centers and projects throughout the world. Under his
            inspiration, Krishna devotees established temples, rural
            communities, educational institutions, and started what would become
            the world’s largest vegetarian food relief program. With the desire
            to nourish the roots of Krishna consciousness in its home, Srila
            Prabhupada returned to India several times, where he sparked a
            revival in the Vaishnava tradition. In India, he opened dozens of
            temples, including large centers in the holy towns of Vrindavana and
            Mayapur. Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contributions, perhaps,
            are his books. He authored over 70 volumes on the Krishna tradition,
            which are highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth,
            fidelity to the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works are
            used as textbooks in numerous college courses. His writings have
            been translated into 76 languages. His most prominent works include:
            Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the 30-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the
            17-volume Sri Chaitanya-charitamrita.
