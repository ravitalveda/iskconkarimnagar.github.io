                  <h4>"The History"</h4>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">

                    The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)
                    was founded in New York City in 1966 by His Divine Grace
                    A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who went to the western
                    world with the mission of spreading the transcendental
                    message of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Supreme Personality
                    of Godhead appearing as a devotee in this age of Kali. Being
                    a part of the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya,
                    one of the four vaishnava sampradayas, ISKCON comes in an
                    authorized disciplic succession of great spiritual
                    preceptors who have taught the science of self realization
                    based on the teachings of the Bhagawat Gita and Srimad
                    Bhagwatam.

                  </p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">
                    The precepts and practices of ISKCON were taught and
                    codified by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486-1532) along with
                    His brother Nityananda Prabhu and six of His principle
                    associates, the Goswamis of Vrindavana (Sanatana, Rupa,
                    Jiva, Gopal Bhatta, Raghunatha Dasa and Raghunatha Bhatta).

                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">
                    The Bhagavad-gita, the principal scripture of The Hare
                    Krishna Movement, is an eternal teaching, having Its’
                    written origins more than 5000-years ago, and before that
                    time it was an oral tradition handed down from teacher to
                    student from time immemorial.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">
                    Sri Chaitanya gave a powerful impetus for a massive bhakti
                    (devotional) movement throughout India. Under His direction
                    hundreds of volumes on the philosophy of Krishna
                    consciousness were compiled. Many devotees followed in the
                    preceptorial line of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu including in
                    the 19th century an outstanding Vaishnava theologian,
                    Bhaktivinoda Thakura (1838-1914) who brought Krishna
                    consciousness to a modern audience by first sending a book
                    on the Teachings of Lord Caitanya to McGill University in
                    Canada in 1896. Bhaktivinoda Thakur’s son, Bhaktisiddhanta
                    Sarasvati Goswami (1874- 1937), became the guru of Srila
                    Prabhupada (1896-1977) and instructed him to spread Krishna
                    consciousness to the English speaking people of the West. On
                    this order, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada took a
                    perilous journey across the Atlantic Ocean to USA in 1965,
                    and consequently started the most auspicious spiritual
                    movement, The International Society for Krishna
                    Consciousness, for the fulfillment of his guru’s desire.
                    ISKCON quickly spread to the major cities of the whole world
                    in a mere 11 years.

                  <h4>"Philosophy"</h4>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">

                    Probably you have already seen members of the Hare Krsna
                    movement singing and dancing in the streets or you have been
                    asked for donation for a book or a magazine. You could also
                    see us in TV or read about us in newspapers. How many times
                    have you asked yourselves: Who are they? Why do they dress
                    in this way? What do they believe in? Why do they always
                    sing? Who is Krsna?
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;"> To enable you to better
                    understand us, we want to show you
                    the Hare Krsna movement in detail and tell you who we are.
                    You will be probably surprised by learning that to become a
                    part of the Hare Krsna movement one does not need to wear
                    traditional dress or change ones hairstyle or religion. You
                    will discover that Krsna consciousness is much more than
                    religion. It is a spiritual, universal, time-proven process
                    enabling to achieve inner happiness, satisfaction and higher
                    consciousness.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;"> Hare Krsna movement makes
                    spiritual reality and culture
                    derived from it known to the widest public. This makes it
                    unique. When you speak with a devotee from the Hare Krsna
                    movement, eat spiritual food served in our restaurants, take
                    part in the Sunday festival in a temple, read any of our
                    books or chant Hare Krsna at least once, your consciousness
                    will change. And this spiritual change of consciousness is
                    the key to improvement of the quality of life on this
                    planet.

                  <h2><strong>Why this Krishna Conscious
                      Movement?</strong></h2>
                  <br>

                  <h4>"The search for happiness"</h4>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">

                    Everyone is looking for happiness but it elusively slips
                    away from everyone. What is the reason that despite our
                    numerous attempts we never feel completely satisfied and
                    when we do feel happy, the bliss is short lived and once
                    again we are plunged into the ocean of miseries. We suffer,
                    even though we don’t want to suffer, we experience loss,
                    heartaches, depression and all such undesirable feelings
                    even though we never want to. What then forces us to go
                    through such emotions and keeps us away from the happiness
                    and peace that all of us are hankering after? The Krishna
                    consciousness movement gives answers to all such questions
                    and gives the perfect path leading to uninterrupted eternal
                    happiness, untinged by any misery, which is to be
                    experienced in the company of the blissful Lord Sri Krishna.
                    The true nature of a living entity is to be eternal, full of
                    knowledge and bliss, but this material creation which is
                    running under the influence of time has a beginning and an
                    end, unlike our actual eternal existence, and is a place of
                    utter misery, unlike our inherent nature to be blissful. We
                    can therefore conclude that we actually do not belong here
                    and are meant to experience something much more sublime.
                    However, we ourselves are responsible for being in this
                    situation, as we made the wrong decision of trying to become
                    that Master and Lord whereas we are by nature meant to be
                    the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Seeing
                    his subordinate souls straying away from their true nature,
                    the Lord arranged for this material world where the living
                    entity can attempt to enjoy independently, but due to being
                    repeatedly unsuccessful, the person is sure to turn back to
                    him and when that happens, the Lord mercifully calls him
                    back to the spiritual realm where there is no birth, death,
                    old age and disease, where there is no misery but true bliss
                    and where the soul experiences ultimate pleasure, being
                    situated in its true nature of loving and associating with
                    Sri Krishna. This is the ultimate destination where true
                    happiness can be realized.
                  </p>

                  <br>
                  <h4>"The process"</h4>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">
                    The path and the destination in the Krishna consciousness
                    movement are one and the same with the only difference being
                    in the quality of the experience in the stages of practice
                    and perfection. The process therefore is most perfect for it
                    strives to bring about the true nature of the soul from the
                    very beginning of the process. The living entities who take
                    up this Krishna consciousness are taught to love and serve
                    Sri Krishna, the exact activity that will be performed in
                    the perfected stage in the spiritual world. In the present
                    situation, this includes chanting the names of the Lord,
                    singing songs in his glorification, dancing for his
                    pleasure, honoring his Mahaprasad, visiting the places where
                    he performed his pastimes and so on. When performed with
                    great faith and enthusiasm, the process itself gives rise to
                    great pleasure, a bliss that cannot be experienced in
                    anything material. The very first side effect of this
                    glorious process is the removal of all miseries, which is
                    what all of us are looking for. And that is just a side
                    effect, the main result being unlimited bliss. Millions have
                    joined this movement and are practicing regularly,
                    experiencing a bliss which is making them desirous of
                    tasting it even further.
                  </p>

                  <h4>"The Goal"</h4>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">
                    The goal is to be transported to the transcendental realm of
                    Sri Krishna, the abode made up of pure eternal bliss and
                    knowledge, where misery, old age, disease and death are non
                    existent. The only experience there will be that of
                    unalloyed love and devotion shared between the Supreme being
                    Sri Krishna and the individual souls.
                  </p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">
                    That blissful abode is beyond material imagination, and the
                    love experienced there is the zenith of all happiness. Sri
                    Vrindavan dham, the abode where the flowering groves are
                    full of fragrant flowers, the river banks studded with
                    jewels, lotuses swaying on the cooling waters of the Yamuna
                    river and birds and beez making sweet sounds, is the place
                    where Sri Krishna enjoys various loving pastimes with his
                    numerous associates such as his friends, parents, servants
                    and beloved Gopis. It is this Vrindavan, the place of the
                    most wonderous pastimes of Sri Krishna, that is the Goal of
                    all the Gaudiya Vaishnavas.
                  </p>
